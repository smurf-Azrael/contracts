<h2>Game Overview</h2>

   At its beginning, X world games is an ecosystem for Players and Creators, consisting of four main components: a card collector, a card creator, a Marketplace, and the game itself.
   The current team began working on X world games in 2019. At the time, the adoption of crypto assets was still in its infancy, as much of the blockchain-based infrastructure necessary for a player-oriented platform was lacking. The team was inspired by the Pokemon Card Game, which is collectible or Trading Card Game ( TCGs) are enormously popular. As of March 2020, the game has sold over 30.4billion cards worldwide.4
X World Games is a decentralized gaming ecosystem built on the Binance Smart Chain and Ethereum. Players and Creators can obtain the X World Games (XWG) Tokes through a variety of innovative games. The first game launched on the platform is Dream Card, inspired by Romance of the Three Kingdoms5. Dream Card are digital, collectible characters built on the Ethereum blockchain and Binance Smart Chain. They can be bought and sold using XWG token, and bred to create new characters with exciting traits and varying levels of cuteness, powerful cards to battle and trade.

In gaming, the element of scarcity and collectible items have been around cards, tools, and skins. Once collectors get enough basic cards, tools, and skin, they could be creators and create new cards or new characters, players will be user-generated content.

Collectible cards and scarcity
Scarcity in Dream Cards exists on differents items:

● Fix supply of basic cards

● Limited editions of skins

● Scarcity limits cards from creators

● Limit cards have special skills in gaming

Fully user-own assets
In mainstream blockchain games, NFT consists of a small amount of binary data that represents ownership of an asset. But there are many more elements needed to actually have full control of an asset:

● How it looks

● Non-physical characteristics

● Game logic implementing the asset

So far, in most blockchain games, this information is often stored elsewhere, not under the control of the player and instead under the full control of the game company.

Players and Creators

X-world games strive to improve on this as much as possible. It stores much more data about items on-chain, using the Binance Smart Chain, a standard for asset definitions from players and creators. So, the items will be defined in a user's-own only, running on-chain and being under the ultimate control of the contributors, see the chapter on Community Council DAO.
